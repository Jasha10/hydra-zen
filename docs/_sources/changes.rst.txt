.. _v0.1.0:

------------------
0.1.0 - 2021-04-10
------------------

This is hydra-zen's first stable release on PyPI!
Although we have not yet released version `v1.0.0`, it should be noted that hydra-zen's codebase is thoroughly tested.
Its test suite makes keen use of the property-based testing library `Hypothesis <https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. 
Furthermore, 100% code coverage is enforced on all commits into `main`.

We plan to have an aggressive release schedule for compatibility-preserving patches of bug-fixes and quality-of-life improvements (e.g. improved type annotations).
hydra-zen will maintain a wide window of compatibility with Hydra versions; we test against pre-releases of Hydra and will maintain compatibility with its future releases.
